    "**`__getattribute__`** is used to find an attribute of a class. \n",
    "It raises an **AttributeError** of it fails to find an attribute of a class. **`__getattr__`** is implemented latter\n",
    "if AttributeError is generated by  **`__getattribute__`**, \n",
    "but for this **`__getattribute__`** and **`__getattr__`** both has to be defined in same class. \n",
    "If no attribute is found, **`__getattr__`** returns a default value. \n",
    "So key difference is that **`__getattr__`** is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class. "
