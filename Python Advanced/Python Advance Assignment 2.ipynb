    "- A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. \n",
    "- An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. \n",
    "- Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch\n",
    "  Whereas in Python, Modules are simply files with the **`.py`** extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python     Program. \n",
