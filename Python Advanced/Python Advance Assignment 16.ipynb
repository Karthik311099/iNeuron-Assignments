    "The **`re.search()`** and **`re.match()`** both are functions of re module in python. These functions are very efficient and fast for searching in strings. The function searches for some substring in a string and returns a match object if found, else it returns none.\n",

Both return the first match of a substring found in the string, but **`re.match()`** searches only from the beginning of the string and return match object if found. But if a match of substring is found somewhere in the middle of the string, it returns none. \n",
